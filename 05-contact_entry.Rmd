# Contact Entry Guidance {-}
Contacts are individuals or organizations that can be referenced by projects or products. Contacts contain information such as the names of individuals or organizations, email address, physical address, website, and phone number so that viewers of metadata can communicate with those affiliated with a metadata record. Contacts also enable users to know who is involved in the creation and maintenance of projects and products, funding of projects, and creation and maintenance of metadata.

In mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records and are stored in the program's archive folder (root folder of all the project archive folders). Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in any metadata record. See the File Management section for import and export guidance. 

You should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors.

Copying contacts will change the ID and the name (the name will be “Copy of ….”) but all the other information will be the same.

```{block, contact_entry_export_contacts-tip, type='rmdtip'}
It is recommended that you export all Contacts to the program's archive folder at the end of each working session and import them before a new session begins (see File Management). This allows for the generation of a single list of contacts for the program that multiple metadata authors can use. 
Always spell out acronyms and organization names.
```

```{block, contact_entry_contacts_loaded-caution, type='rmdcaution'}
Make sure your contacts are loaded and accurate in mdEditor before creating or editing your metadata records.
```

## Individual Contacts {-}
1. Click the `r knitr::include_graphics("images/symbol_plus_16.png")` by Contacts.
2. Specify the contact is an Individual.
3. The Contact ID will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

*The following fields are available for Individual Contacts*:

- **Individual Name** (*Required*): Enter individual's full name If you are entering a generic Individual contact, you can enter a Position Name without entering an Individual Name. For example: you could enter I&M Data Manager as a Position Name rather than an Individual Name.

- **Position Name** (*Required*): Enter individual's full title; avoid acronyms If you have entered the individual's name, Position Name is not required (one or the other is required, but not both).

- **Contact Type** (*Required*): Enter the contact type from the picklist. Make sure every contact has Contact Type selected.

- **Member Organization** (*Required*): Select organization(s). You can make an individual part of multiple organizations.

- **Email Address** (*Required*): Enter individual's email

- **Physical Address** (*Best Practice*): Enter a physical address

- **Logo** (*Optional*):
  + It is uncommon that you would add a logo for an individual. If the individual is part of an organization, the individual will inherit the logo from the organization.
  + You can either select or drop an image. If you choose to load an image, mdEditor will create a URI and will have a size limit for the logo. If you have a larger image, link to it rather than loading it into mdEditor.

If you upload a logo to your contact record, you must include a filename for the logo. Otherwise you will get an error on the metadata records that include that contact.

## Organization Contacts {-}

1. Click the `r knitr::include_graphics("images/symbol_plus_16.png")` by **Contacts**.
2. Specify the contact is an **Organization**.
3. The **Contact ID** will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

*The following fields are available for* **Organization Contacts**:

- **Organization Name** (*Required*): The organization's full name; avoid acronyms (however, abbreviating United States as U.S. is acceptable. Example: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).

- **Contact Type** (*Required*): Enter the contact type from the picklist. Make sure every contact has Contact Type selected.

- **Email Address** (*Required*): Add an email address of the primary contact in the organization.

- **Online Resource** (*Required*): Add a web URL where the organization resides. Online resource may also include social networks.

- **Physical Address** (*Best Practice*): Enter a physical address

- **Logo** (*Optional*):
  + You can either select or drop an image. If you choose to load an image, mdEditor will create a URI and will have a size limit for the logo. If you have a larger image, link to it rather than loading it into mdEditor.
  + If an organization has a logo associated with it, individuals will inherit the logos from the organization.

```{block, contact_entry_logo-warning, type='rmdwarning'}
If you upload a logo to your contact record, you must include a filename for the logo. Otherwise you will get an error on the metadata records that include that contact.
```
