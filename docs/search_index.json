["workflow.html", "Workflow From Scratch Editing and Re-Export", " Workflow The following is a suggested workflow for using mdEditor to create and save metadata records for AK-Region projects and products. Workflow can begin from scratch or by working with existing metadata records. From Scratch Follow this workflow if you do not have existing project or product metadata. Step 1: Gather information needed for your metadata entries. Have information about your contacts, projects, and products on hand before you begin creating metadata records. Key information to gather includes project proposals, project reports, product information, and contact information for individuals and organizations involved in the projects. Step 2: Open mdEditor. The direct link to mdEditor is https://go.mdeditor.org. Choose the browser you plan to use for mdEditor and bookmark this link. mdEditor can also be accessed from its homepage at https://www.mdeditor.org/. This site provides some background information and Frequently Asked Questions about mdEditor. Step 3: Set the correct default Settings. [ Under development ] Step 4: Upload or Create Contacts. Contacts must be uploaded from the program archive folder or created before they can be added to project and product metadata records. See Contact Entry Guidance for more information. Step 5: Upload Data Dictionaries. Upload existing data dictionaries from the program archive folder. If applicable, these can be reused across product metadata records. Step 6: Create Projects. Create an mdEditor project record from scratch. Step 7: Create Products. Create an mdEditor product record from scratch. Step 8: For applicable Products, create Data Dictionaries. For tabular data products, if an existing data dictionary does not describe the product, create a new data dictionary. Step 9: Complete metadata. Step 10: Create desired Associations between Projects and/or Products. Associations can be either associated from a project or associated from a product. Step 11: Publish your records to ScienceBase. [ Under development ] Step 12: Export your records and contacts for backup, transfer, or sharing. Export the project and product records to the project’s archive folder (incoming folder) on your program’s network drive. These records should be moved from your incoming folder to the metadata folder of the project by the data custodian. Rename this file “project_name.json.” For example, MBMWF_011_YKDNestPlot.json would be the metadata record for the YK Delta nest plot survey project conducted by the Waterfowl Program in MBM (it was the 11th project archive record created by the program). Separately export all contacts and all data dictionaries to the program’s archive folder (root folder that contains all project archive folders). Editing and Re-Export Follow this workflow if you have already created metadata and need to update it. Step 1: Gather information needed for your metadata entries. Have the necessary information to update your metadata records readily accessible before you begin. Step 2: Open mdEditor. The direct link to mdEditor is https://go.mdeditor.org. Choose the browser you plan to use for mdEditor and bookmark this link. mdEditor can also be accessed from its homepage at https://www.mdeditor.org/. This site provides some background information and Frequently Asked Questions about mdEditor. Step 3: Import mdEditor file. Import the mdEditor JSON file that you wish to edit from the project’s archive folder. Step 4: Check the Settings. [ Under development ] Step 5: Update Contacts. Import the Contact file from the program’s archive folder. If you have new contacts to add to your metadata record, create those contacts and add them to the record. Step 6: Update Projects. Update/edit metadata as needed. Step 7: Update Products. Update/edit metadata as needed. Step 8: For applicable Products, create, import, or update Data Dictionaries. Import the Data Dictionaries file from the program’s archive folder. If you have new data dictionaries to add to your metadata record, create those dictionaries and add them to the record. Step 9: Check Associations between Projects and/or Products. If you only updated metadata in existing records that were already associated, you do not need to do anything with the associations. If you created a new product for your project, then associate those records in mdEditor. Step 10: Publish your records to ScienceBase. [ Under development ] Step 11: Export your records and contacts for backup, transfer, or sharing. Export the project and product records to the project’s archive folder (incoming folder) on your program’s network drive. These records should be moved from your incoming folder to the metadata folder of the project by the data custodian. Rename this file “project_name.json.” For example, MBMWF_011_YKDNestPlot.json would be the metadata record for the YK Delta nest plot survey project conducted by the Waterfowl Program in MBM (it was the 11th project archive record created by the program). Separately export all contacts and all data dictionaries back to the program’s archive folder (root folder that contains all project archive folders). "],
["file-management.html", "File Management How mdEditor Stores Information mdEditor File Format Import Export Copy Records", " File Management File management in mdEditor consists of consistent and proper handling and storage of mdEditor derived formats of metadata. These files are essential for long-term access to metadata beyond a single work session. How mdEditor Stores Information mdEditor stores information on your local computer in your browser’s localStorage cache (not the normal file cache). This means that if you use a different browser to access mdEditor, it will not show the metadata records from your original browser. It also means that clearing your browser’s cache generally will not delete your mdEditor records. However, depending on your browser’s settings, clearing your browser cache may still delete your mdEditor data (e.g., in Chrome, checking the “cookies and other site data” option will clear your mdEditor data). In mdEditor settings, you can clear your storage cache. Doing so will remove all of the information currently loaded in mdEditor. Reasons you might want to clear your storage cache is due to too much information stored in the cache, or as a way to debug a problem with mdEditor. It is very important that you back up your records before clearing the mdEditor cache to avoid losing your data. Consult the Export or Settings section of this manual to learn more. mdEditor File Format JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open-standard file format with file extension .json. The underlying format of the metadata from mdEditor is mdJSON, which was created specifically for mdEditor. There are two types of mdJSON files. mdJSON files are the format that is published from mdEditor and can be made available on ScienceBase and data.gov. Their default file name is md_metadata.json. mdEditor files are the files used by mdEditor and that are stored into the project’s archive record. They contain extra information, such as settings, that tell mdEditor how to operate. Their default file name is mdeditor-timestamp.json. mdEditor files will be exported and imported to/from the project’s archive record Import The Import function loads an mdEditor or mdJSON file into the current mdEditor session. You can also import existing ScienceBase metadata or FGDC (Federal Geographic Data Committee) metadata into mdEditor to create mdJSON. General Import Settings Replace vs. Merge The Replace/Merge toggle allows you to either replace or merge the imported records with the records currently loaded in mdEditor. When importing existing mdEditor files from the project archive folder, choose “Replace.” That will ensure that only those records associated with the project you are working on are loaded into the mdEditor. In most instances, when you import the Contacts or Data Dictionary records, you should select “Merge.” That will ensure that the master file of contacts or data dictionary records, stored in the program archive folder, will be updated with any new entries added to the mdEditor. Import Screen You can click or drag and drop a file onto the Import Data button to import a local file. Review the selected information. If there is more than one copy of the same metadata record or contact, use the “preview JSON” button to choose the record or contact with the most complete information. Select the records you want to import. Switch the Replace/Merge toggle to “Replace” for project/product records and “Merge” for Contact and Data Dictionary records. Click on the right hand button “Click to Import Data.” Export The export function allows the current set of metadata records to be saved as an mdEditor or mdJSON file. The saved files can be shared with collaborators, imported into another record set, or imported into another browser. Exported mdEditor files should be saved as a backup or archival copy in the project’s archive folder. Using Export to Backup Records Exporting records is the only way to save mdEditor files outside of your browser cache. You should backup by exporting an mdEditor JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor or switch browsers. mdEditor files vs. mdJSON files mdJSON files can be uploaded and translated to other formats via the mdTranslator application while mdEditor files are exclusive to the mdEditor application and retain all mdEditor information, including Settings. Best Practices -Export project and product records to the project’s archive folder as an mdEditor JSON file. Include Settings. -Export the contact and data dictionary records to the program’s archive folder as mdEditor JSON files. Include Settings. These records are backed up in a different location because they are reused across many projects. -It is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor’s Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered into the mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records. Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn more. Export Options While exporting data, there are four options available (on the right side of the export data window). Export All: will export everything currently loaded in mdEditor into a single file. Exports an mdEditor JSON file. Export Selected: will only export the items you have selected (so individual records, contacts, etc.). If nothing is selected it will be disabled (i.e., grayed out). This exports an mdEditor JSON file. Export mdJSON: only works for metadata records (i.e., doesn’t work for contacts). Exports just the mdJSON file, which is a standalone JSON file you can load into mdTranslator and have translated into other metadata formats. mdJSON files imported into mdEditor are treated as new records and will not merge/update an existing record. Clicking the Include Settings switch will also export mdEditor settings (only for mdEditor files). Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn about settings. Copy Records The Copy button is located in the mdEditor action menu on the right-hand side of the screen. The Copy Button allows you to make a duplicate of an existing metadata record. Making a copy of a record can be used to: Start a new product, project, or contact record. Populate multiple products faster (e.g., multiple workshop reports, a poster based on a publication). Create a “template record” for a project that can be used as a starting place for each full metadata record. A template record can contain information commonly used across your projects or products (such as contacts). Use the Copy button carefully: Making a copy will generate a new Record ID for the copied record and be named “Copy of …”. All the other info will remain the same including associations. The “Metadata Identifier” is NOT copied but any identifiers in the Main Citation WILL be copied. It is extremely important to review all copied identifiers and delete any that do not apply to the new record. Leaving in identifiers that do not belong could result in your new item being published to the wrong location. Before saving, carefully review all information in copied record to ensure all copied info is still relevant to the copied record, particularly any identifiers. "],
["settings.html", "Settings General Settings ScienceBase Import Settings Defaults Publishing Settings", " Settings The settings menu allows for the configuring of user-specific options. General Settings mdEditor Version: The mdEditor version notes the current version of mdEditor. Use this when reporting errors. Errors can be reported at https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues. You must have a github account in order to post. Auto-Save: The Auto-Save option will write all changes to local storage when you exit a data entry field. Changes must be manually saved if the Auto-Save feature is turned off. Auto-Save allows you to save less frequently, but it makes it harder to undo changes that you make to your records. If you stay on the same record, you can cancel changes. But once you leave the record, the record is saved and you can’t cancel the change except by manually re-editing the record. Clear All Records: All records can be cleared by clicking the “Clear Storage Cache.” Be sure to back up all records (project and product records to the project’s archive folder, contacts and data dictionaries to the program’s archive folder) before clearing all records. Clearing all records will delete all of the records currently loaded in mdEditor. Before doing so, use the Export function to make a backup of your records. Otherwise, the records will be permanently lost (unless you previously made a backup copy). ScienceBase Import Settings [Under development] Defaults Defaults include settings for Language, Character Set, Country, and the Import URL (used for defining the default URL for importing). The following defaults will be pre-loaded: - default language: English - default character set: UTF-8 - default location: USA Also included in Defaults are the Metadata Repositories (online databases for storing metadata).

["dictionary-entry-guidance.html", "Dictionary Entry Guidance Creating a New Data Dictionary Main Tab Citation Tab Entities Tab Domain Tab", " Dictionary Entry Guidance Data dictionaries define the characteristics of attributes (also called variables or column names) that make up an entity (also called a table). A single data dictionary can describe the attributes of a single table or a collection of tables, like a database. Like Contacts, data dictionaries are created separately from Product records. Also like Contacts, dictionaries can be reused across products and are stored outside the project archive folder in the program archive folder. It is recommended that you export all Data dictionaries to the program’s archive folder at the end of each working session and import them before a new session begins (see File Management). This allows for the generation of a single list of dictionaries for the program that multiple metadata authors can use. After a data dictionary has been described, it can be added to the product metadata record (see Dictionaries tab). Creating a New Data Dictionary If an existing data dictionary does not describe the product you are working on, create a new data dictionary by clicking the by Dictionaries. Give the dictionary a title and chose tabularDataset as the subject. Meaningful titles will help link the data dictionary to its product(s) while building the product metadata record. Click Save. Main Tab Quick Reference: Dictionary Main Tab Required? Basic Information: Title, Subject Required Responsible Party Required Responsible Party (Required) Adding a point of contact gives users information on who to contact should they have a question regarding your dictionary.

Role Contact Required? pointOfContact Identified in Roles and Responsibilities Required author Identified in Roles and Responsibilities Best Practice principalInvestigator The Project PI Best Practice The point of contact for a project should be identified with Roles and Responsibilities (see Interim DM Implementation Guide). This is an interim solution as the point of contact can become obsolete if there is a positional change within an organization. Citation Tab Quick Reference: Dictionary Citation Tab Required? Title Required Date Best Practice Responsible Parties Required Dates (Best Practice) Add at least one date. Recommended are “creation” (when you first created your dictionary) and “lastUpdate” (when you updated the dictionary after initial publication). Responsible Parties (Required) Responsible Parties are required. Adding these will give users a contact point should they have any questions about the dictionary. Role Contact Required? author Identified in Roles and Responsibilities At least one is required pointOfContact Identified in Roles and Responsibilities Required Entities Tab An Entity is a table. More than one entity can be described by a single data dictionary, as with a database. Using the “Import CSV” button in the Entities Tab will allow you to pre-populate information in your data dictionary with the tabular dataset(s) you are documenting. Using the “Import CSV” functionality is highly recommended to start defining a data dictionary. Click “Import CSV” on the right hand side of the window. Either navigate to the tabular dataset you are documenting or drag-and-drop the file. Check that the Names and Data Types were correctly imported. Check “Domain” box for an attribute if you wish to limit the entries allowed for the attribute (for example, allowing “Female” and “Male” for the attribute “Sex”). Check “Allow Null” values if the attribute is allowed to have missing entries. Check “Max/Min” if you would like to set maximum and minimum values for the attribute. After checking each attribute for these characteristics, click “Do Import.” Repeat this process for each entity that is described by the data dictionary. Entity Information Give a name to the entity in “Code Name” and a brief definition for the entity. Attributes The attributes (variables or column names) imported from the tabular dataset will be listed in a table and you must provide a brief definition for each. Additional information about the attribute can be described by clicking “More.” Domain Tab Domains are discrete, allowable values that an attribute might take. For example, the attribute “Color” in a table may only be allowed to take values “Red,” “Green,” and “Yellow.” Each attribute that you checked the “Domain” box for during csv import (see the Entities Tab for import guidance) will be listed in a table under the Domain tab. For each, you must describe the allowable domains. Click “More” for each attribute. Give the attribute a short description in the Domain Information box (this can be the same definition provided for it in the Entities tab). Under Domain Items, give a short definition for each allowable domain. Click “Back to Domains” and repeat for each attribute requiring defined domains. "],

Before You Begin Select the lccProject Profile: After creating your project record and before you begin adding metadata, select lccProject from the Profile drop-down in the main menu. This will limit the number of available tabs and only show tabs that contain fields that are applicable to project metadata. Make sure your contacts are loaded into mdEditor: In mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records and then stored within a library in mdEditor. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in any metadata records. You should maintain a single list of your contacts in the program’s archive folder (root folder that contains all project archive folders). Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors.

It can be edited but it should only be edited if absolutely necessary (and ideally edited as soon as the record is created in mdEditor). Title (Required) Enter as informative a title as possible. Good titles, when they appear in a search, will be understood and/or traceable. Status (Required) The Status drop-down menu allows you to select the status of your project. Choose status ONLY from the four following options: completed, ongoing, proposed, or accepted. Default Locale Default Locale allows for the selection of Language, Character Set, and Country. English, UTF-8, and USA will be selected by default, but you may change them if necessary. Resource Types (Required) For projects, the Resource Type should be automatically filled in with the resource type you selected when you created your record. This should be “project” for all AK-Region projects. Name is optional. You can leave this blank or use the Short Title from the archive record. Points of Contact Adding a point of contact gives users information on who to contact should they have a question regarding your project or product. To add contacts to a metadata record, you must first create/upload the contacts into mdEditor. See the Contact Section for more information. Contacts Role Contact Required? pointOfContact Identified in Roles and Responsibilities Required principalInvestigator The Project PI Best Practice The point of contact for a project should be identified with Roles and Responsibilities (see Interim DM Implementation Guide). This is an interim solution as the point of contact can become obsolete if there is a positional change within an organization. Citation The Citation describes pertinent information about your project such as: responsible parties, internal identifiers, and any online resources that may relate to your item. Adding information in the citation will also improve users’ ability to find your items. Citation Required Fields Title (Required) The citation title is automatically populated with the title of your record. Alternate Title (Optional) You can add an alternate title if desired, such as the Short Title used in the archive record. Dates (Optional) Enter acquisition, creation, revision, or another date reference from the picklist and then enter the date. Responsible Parties (Required) Responsible parties must include a point of contact, but may also include the other responsible parties identified in Roles and Responsibilities (see Interim DM Implementation Guide) such as custodian, editor (data steward), and administrator.

Identifier (Best Practice) You may enter as many identifiers as desired. At a minimum, include the full archive record name here. Example: AFB_001_SockeyeFyke Description Description allows for the addition of the Abstract as well as a Short Abstract, and Supplemental Information. Abstract (Required) Enter an abstract that succinctly describes the project’s purpose and goals. Include key species or habitats as well. Write your project abstract in the present tense if the project is in progress and past tense if the project has been completed. Short Abstract (Optional) Enter a short description, limited to 300 characters, if desired. Enter comments, if desired. Time Period Time Period refers to project start and end date. This set of dates is distinct from the fiscal year of funding. Here you want to indicate the overall project start and end dates. Dates (Required) For each project, add a Start Date and End Date. If the project spanned a single fiscal year, you can use the “Pick a Fiscal Year” dropdown to autofill the date fields. Metadata Tab {#project-metadata} The Metadata tab describes your project’s metadata, including a description that outlines the process of metadata creation, contributors to the creation of the metadata, and metadata repositories. Quick Reference: Metadata Tab Required? Basic Information: Metadata Status, Dates Best Practice Metadata Contacts Required Metadata Identifier Required Basic Information Metadata Status (Best Practice) Select the appropriate status of the creation of your metadata from the drop down menu. For example, if you have added all of your metadata, select “completed.” If you still have metadata to add, select “onGoing.” Dates (Best Practice) Add at least one date. Recommended are “creation” (when you first created your metadata) and “lastUpdate” (when you updated metadata after initial publication). Metadata Contacts Metadata Contacts are required. Adding a metadata contact will give users a contact point should they have any questions about the metadata. Role Contact Required? author Identified in Roles and Responsibilities At least one is required pointOfContact Identified in Roles and Responsibilities Required Metadata Identifier The Metadata Identifier is automatically populated by mdEditor by generating a universally unique identifier (UUID). The metadata identifier gives each of your projects and products a unique ID and differentiates them from other similar projects and products. Once a Metadata Identifier is created in the metadata, do not change it. mdEditor uses the Metadata Identifier to connect records and changing the Metadata Identifier can break those connections. If there are additional identifiers you want to include in your metadata record, include them in Main/Citation/Identifier. Parent Metadata [Under development] Metadata Repositories [Under development] Keyword Tab Adding keywords to your metadata record allows for the record to be found later through a search engine. Keywords are the way to tag your projects or products. The mdEditor is designed using thesauruses that contain pre-determined keywords. Quick Reference: Keyword Tab Required? ISO Topic Category Required GCMD Keywords Best Practice Add Keywords to your Project Click “+ Add Thesaurus” on the right to add the different thesauruses. From the drop down box, pick a thesaurus. Add keywords from the following pre-populated thesauruses. If none of the keywords in the following categories are sufficient for tagging your project, you can add other keywords with a custom thesaurus (see below for more information). ISO Topic Category Thesaurus (Required) Because mdJSON metadata is based on the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) metadata standard, all projects must select at least one ISO Topic Category. ISO topics were generally meant for spatial data so they might be a bit of a stretch, but do your best to find the best fit. mdEditor provides definitions of each ISO topic category if you hover over the ? icon. ISO Topic List: biota boundaries climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere economy elevation environment geoscientificInformation health imageryBaseMapsEarthCover intelligenceMilitary inlandWaters location oceans planningCadastre society structure transportation utilitiesCommunication Biota and environment are probably the best fit for most AK-Region projects. GCMD Keywords Thesaurus (Best Practice) GCMD stands for Global Change Master Directory and these keywords are maintained by NASA. Look for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. There are GCMD Platforms and Instruments Keywords but they are unlikely to apply to LCCs. Check the “Full Path” checkbox to save the full path of the keyword to your metadata. This will maintain the category and context of the specific keywords chosen. Custom Thesaurus If any of your desired keywords do not appear in the existing thesauruses, you can add them using a custom thesaurus. Use a custom thesaurus only for keywords that are not available in an existing thesaurus. You cannot add keywords to an existing thesaurus; you can only add keywords in a custom thesaurus. You cannot save a custom thesaurus in mdEditor. If you have a consistent set of keywords that you use across your projects, you could add these to a “template project” record in mdEditor and then modify the specific keywords you need for each project. See the workflow section for more info about using template records. Keywords and ScienceBase [Under development] Extent Tab Extent refers to geographic boundaries for your project. Spatial extents lets users see at a glance the geographic footprint of your project and allows searching within specific geographic areas. Quick Reference: Extent Tab Required? Extent Required Creating Extents There are multiple ways to create a spatial extent for your project. Clicking the Edit Extent Features button allows for the addition of Feature Properties such as: ID, Name, or Description. You can draw a polygon or a bounding box in the initial window. You can export spatial extents and re-use for other records using the import feature button or by dragging and dropping onto the map. Extents are limited to 5000 vertices. Recommend you create only simple polygons or bounding boxes. If you want greater detail, attach high-definition shapefiles instead of trying to draw them. Extents should be accurate enough for searching purposes, but remember that they are metadata, not data. Option 1: Import Spatial Features Spatial features such as geoJSON, shapefiles, and kml can be imported. However, file attributes (such as name and description), will not be imported and must be added manually. Important: coordinates used must be geographic coordinates, not projected coordinates. Option 2: Draw Spatial Features It is easier to click “finish” when drawing a polygon instead of trying to close the polygon by clicking on the first point. Option 3: Draw Bounding Box mdEditor can automatically calculate a bounding box if you have at least one extent in the metadata. Bounding boxes will not work across the dateline but you can have more than one extent per project. If your project area crosses the dateline, split the area into multiple extents and create separate bounding boxes. Saving and Exporting Extents You can export, save, and import an extent to use for other projects or products. Taxonomy Tab Taxonomy is required for projects and strongly recommended for products (where applicable). Quick Reference: Taxonomy Tab Required? Taxonomy Required, if applicable Taxonomy mdEditor’s new “Taxonomy” section automatically pulls in taxonomic information from ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System – see itis.gov for more information). Please note that this functionality in mdEditor is not intended to explore ITIS. It is a tool to add known taxonomic information to your metadata. If you want to explore ITIS, go to itis.gov to find information and then come back to mdEditor with the desired search values. The minimum requirements for valid taxonomy are a Taxonomic System plus one or more taxonomic classifications. Add Taxonomic System Click “Add Collection” From here, you can click “Add Taxa from ITIS” directly (on right side) without adding the taxonomic system. This will be filled in for you automatically once you have added items from ITIS. Enter your search terms in the search box. You can type in a common name, scientific name, or TSN (Taxonomic Serial Number, assigned by ITIS). You can type in any level of taxonomy, not just species name (e.g., you can type in an order or class or genus). You can specify by Kingdom if you like. If you haven’t used the search in a while (or ever) the ITIS service might be asleep so it will take a few more seconds to load but then will load quickly after that. The status of the taxonomic classification is denoted in () after the TSN. ITIS may consider a classification “invalid” if the species was reclassified, for example. It is up to you whether you want to add invalid ITIS classifications to your metadata. Click “Add” for the search results you want to add to your record and then click “Import Taxa.” You will get a message of successful import at the bottom of your screen. You don’t need to worry about clicking import multiple times for the same species. mdEditor is smart enough to know not to create duplicate entries of the same species. Click “Back to Collection.” You will see that it has added a taxonomic hierarchy. It has also added a Title to Taxonomic System (if you hadn’t already added one by hand). This completes the minimum information required for taxonomy. You can click on any level of the taxonomic hierarchy to collapse the entries below that level. mdEditor only adds common names at the lowest taxonomic level you identified (e.g., species level). You can add additional information regarding the taxonomic information if you desire. Observers would be filled out when there were people who actually went in the field/lab and identified species. Here you would lie the people who did that work. General Scope: You can add a description of the range of taxa addressed in the dataset or collection. Identification Procedure: You can describe the methods used for taxonomic identification. Identification Completeness: You can add information regarding completeness and uncertainty in the identifications. Voucher is where you can add information about specimens you submitted to a museum or a storage facility where you are storing specimens, can document that here (select a Repository via a Contact entered in mdEditor). When Taxonomy is Needed Taxonomy is mostly used for search is discovery and functions similar to keywords. If you have existing species names or other keywords, you do not need to delete those. Taxonomy is entered in a separate section in mdJSON so they are separate from Keywords. To some extent, this is up to the judgement of the data manager. You will know best the connection of a resource to a specific species or other taxonomic group. For example, if a bear model was used to rank habitat for a prioritization product but the final output is not relevant to bears any longer, then you probably wouldn’t want to add bear species in taxonomy. Reporting Issues If you encounter issues or bugs using the new Taxonomy feature, please report them in this github thread: https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues/101 (requires github account to post). Associated Tab The Associated section is used to connect metadata records with each other. This feature should be used when items are related, for example, products are often the result of projects, and projects often have sub-projects. Projects and Products can be linked together by using association. Adding associations gives users the ability to find items that relate to each other. Create Associations In mdEditor you can either create the association from the Project record or the Product record. The “Association Type” will define the association from your current record to the linked record. Specifying the “Linked Association Type” will create the association from the other direction. It is recommended you ALWAYS specify the Linked Association Type when you create associations. This will ensure the associations are defined from both directions and be present in the metadata no matter how the metadata is translated or where it is used in the future. Associations can only be made after both project and product records have been created in mdEditor. Quick Reference: Creating an Association in a Project Record 1. Select “product” from the Association Type drop-down menu. 2. Use the Select a Record button to select an associated product. 3. Choose the product that you would like to associate from the “Select a Resource” list. 4. Fill out the Linked Association Type with “parentProject.” Step-by-Step: Creating an Association in a Project Record Step 1: Select “product” from the Association Type drop-down menu. This field will describe the relationship from the associated record to the project record (the associated record is the product of the project record you are editing). Step 2: Click the “Select a Record” button to select an associated product. Step 3: Choose the product that you would like to associate from the Select a Resource list. Step 4: Fill out the Linked Association Type with “parentProject.” "]
