This manual describes the INTERIM requirements and best practices for the creation of high-quality and consistent metadata records for projects and products from the Alaska Region (AK-Region) of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). These metadata requirements conform to the standardized metadata format agreed upon by the Alaska Region Data Stewardship Team (DST). This metadata ensures that AK-Region projects and products are discoverable, accessible, and usable.
